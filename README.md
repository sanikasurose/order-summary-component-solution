# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj).

## Overview

I estimate this will take me 2 hours.
It actually took me around 2.5.

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### What I learned

This activity was great practice. I got to practice positioning a bit more, which I am pretty confident with now.  

### Continued development

Making the background was really interesting, adding the image to make a pattern. I had to figure out how to get it to line up with the card, which was quite difficult, but it was fun. I want to explore the other ways to add a pattern to the background and make it more interesting than just a simple solid color.
